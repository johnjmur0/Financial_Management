# Financial_Management
R scripts to do personal financial analysis and projections. Mostly based on Intuit Mint output

It requires a significant amount of setup as well as utilization of Mint the same way I do, so it's not available for general purpose use at this time.

So, while I do use it for my personal finances and as a sandbox for some demos like renv and R in VS Code, it's a public repo in order to display my love-hate relationship with R :)

Feel free to reach out if you're a Mint user or an R user, though!
