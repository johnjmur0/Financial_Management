# Financial_Management
R scripts to do personal financial analysis and projections. Mostly based on Intuit Mint output

It requires a significant amount of setup as well as utilization of Mint the same way I do, so I wouldn't recommend trying to use it.

However there are some neat things in here like renv and R in VS Code I may come back to. 

Feel free to reach out if you're a Mint user or an R user, though! 

P.S. I deleted this git history b/c there was some personal info which I've sinced moved out of the repo.
